    <description>Allows user to adjust the wealth value of a pawns skills.
    
    I mostly made this mod for a content creator but I am releasing it to any others who would like to use it. Adjusting the wealth value
    that a pawns skills add to a colony will alter the raid value calculation that your storyteller uses to decide how powerful your next
    raid will be.
